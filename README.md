## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

Through various stages of my career, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of technology. I am committed to continuous learning, staying adaptable to new advancements while maintaining a critical perspective—leveraging technology thoughtfully rather than following trends blindly.

---

I am a person who is constantly trying to find **fulfilment** in life by following my dreams and values such a **honesty**, **truthfulness** and **transparency**.

I try to spread these **values** amongst my colleagues and co-workers. I love people, the sun, warm countries (especially 🇹🇭 Thailand, 🇻🇳 Vietnam, Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and Cyprus 🇨🇾 ). Looking for meaningfulness in life is one of my main goals.

I have been in the business of broadly understood **e-commerce** and **Internet marketing** for **14 years now**. This is how I managed to transpose the theoretical knowledge gained during my studies in IT into practical experience online.

Being a radio DJ 🎧  with a philosophical twist 🤔 is my passion and I have also spent half of my life working at various bars 🍸 .
