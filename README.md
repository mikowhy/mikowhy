# 👋 Hi there, it's Mikolaj!

### 👨‍💻Who am I?

#### 14 years in digital marketing, wonna be python dev!

I am a person who is constantly trying to find **fulfilment** in life by following my dreams and values such a **honesty**, **truthfulness** and **transparency**.

I try to spread these **values** amongst my colleagues and co-workers. I love people, the sun, warm countries (especially Bulgaria, Cyprus) and my cat. Looking for meaningfulness in life is one of my main goals.

I have been in the business of broadly understood **e-commerce** and **Internet marketing** for **14 years now**. This is how I managed to transpose the theoretical knowledge gained during my studies in IT into practical experience online.

Being a radio DJ with a philosophical twist is my passion and I have also spent half of my life working at various bars.

Some time ago I decided to go back to programming. My goal was to learn **Python** 🐍 so... here I am

### 💟Interests
People, fulfilment, meaningfulness, wholeness, minimalism, teal, Bulgaria, Cyprus, my cat…
