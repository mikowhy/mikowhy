# 👋 Hi there, it's Mikolaj!

### 👨‍💻Who am I?

#### 1️⃣4️⃣  years in digital marketing made me understand that real power is in the technology.
#### 🐍 Python Developer 🐍 @ [Merixstudio.com](https://www.merixstudio.com/)

I am a person who is constantly trying to find **fulfilment** in life by following my dreams and values such a **honesty**, **truthfulness** and **transparency**.

I try to spread these **values** amongst my colleagues and co-workers. I love people, the sun, warm countries (especially Bulgaria 🇧🇬, Cyprus 🇨🇾 ) and my cat 🐈. Looking for meaningfulness in life is one of my main goals.

I have been in the business of broadly understood **e-commerce** and **Internet marketing** for **14 years now**. This is how I managed to transpose the theoretical knowledge gained during my studies in IT into practical experience online.

Being a radio DJ 🎧  with a philosophical twist 🤔 is my passion and I have also spent half of my life working at various bars 🍸 .

Some time ago I decided to go back to programming. My goal is to learn **Python** 🐍  so... here I am
